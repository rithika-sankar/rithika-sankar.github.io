A side effect of getting educated in a formerly colonised country is having to learn science in English. I'm from Chennai, India, and I grew up speaking [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language). So while I think in Tamizh/ Tamil, I learnt to do science in English. While doing science in English gave me the ease of communication with others who don't speak the same language as me, I think doing and learning science in just English is often inaccessible and excludes the larger community from science. To bridge this gap, my department organised an event where we got to present something about our research or our subfield in our native language. I made a short video introducing stem cells and the ways they are used in research in Tamil. You can view it here:
