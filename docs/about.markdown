<img width ="400" align = left id="profile" src = "/rithika-pic.JPG"/>   Hi everyone! It's nice to meet you. Thanks for visiting my page. I'm a 3rd year PhD candidate in Dr. Sarah Hainer's lab  at the University of Pittsburgh. I'm interested in chromatin and stem cell biology.  Currently, in the Hainer lab I work on understanding how the histone chaperone FACT promotes stem cell pluripotency.
