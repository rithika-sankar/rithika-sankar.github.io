<img width ="300" align = left hspace = "10" id="profile" src = "/Rithika_headshot.JPG"/> Hi! It's nice to meet you. Thanks for visiting my page. I'm a 4th year PhD candidate in [Dr. Sarah Hainer's](https://www.hainerlab.com/) lab  at the University of Pittsburgh. I am interested in understanding how chromatin regulation influences cell fate decisions.  Currently, in the Hainer lab I work on understanding how the histone chaperone FACT promotes stem cell pluripotency. 

While pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Genetic Engineering in India, I was selected for a research fellowship at the University of Washington in the Ruohola-Baker lab where I studied how stem cells transition from naïve to primed cell states. This sparked my interests in understanding cell fate decisions, I then studied the role of calcium channels in neurodegeneration in Dr. Gaiti Hasan’s lab at National Centre for Biological Sciences in India. Alongside my research pursuits, I am a consultant at Fourth River Solutions, I actively lead science communication and outreach efforts, and I am passionate about mentoring. Both within the lab and through various programs, I have directly mentored several high school students, undergraduates, and pre-doctoral students.
